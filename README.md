This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## This is a test project, most of the errors are not handled

### I made this just to learn the new features that's coming in the next13 beta

Since I didn't make a index page you'll be redirected to [signin](https://next13-app-folder-experimental.vercel.app/signin), but if you ever logged the redirect middleware won't trigger so you probably will get a 404, just go to [/home](https://next13-app-folder-experimental.vercel.app/home)
